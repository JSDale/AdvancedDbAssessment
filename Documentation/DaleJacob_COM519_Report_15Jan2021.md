# Abstract

I was tasked to create a ***proof of concept*** web application that is attached to a database on the backend to solve a real world problem. The real world problem would have preferably been one experienced in work, unfortunately my work place currently has no need for a web application so I used a real world problem from my personal life. The application and server should be hosted on an external server, such as Heroku and Atlas MongoDB, it should show I have an understanding of current work place practices, it should also be saleable and maintainable.

## Mission Statement

I am a leader of a small youth group (ages 10 - 16) belonging to the local Church of England church in my village and currently we must rely on our memories for the medical requirements of the children. We also only use a paper register for each of our meetings, this is problematic as that is our only copy and if we loose it we have no record of who attended when. This can also cause an issue in an event of a disaster, such as fire. If we can't get that to that register to ensure everyone is out and safe it might result in injury or death.

We have a duty of care to those children and their parents trust us with said care. Having an online resource to keep track of attendance and medical requirements would be a great help, as sometimes we get the kids to bring in food for end of year parties etc... so if they could see what the dietary requirements of other kids are there is less risk of allergic reactions. According to the NHS *https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/find-data-and-publications/supplementary-information/2018-supplementary-information-files/hospital-admissions-for-allergies-and-anaphylactic-shock*, the number of Finished Admission Episode (FAEs) with primary diagnosis of allergies for the year **2013-14** for ages **10 and under** were **4,869** and ages 11 to 18 were **2,873**. For the year 2017-18 **10 and under** were **6,167** and 11 to 18 were **4,743**.

I would also like to implement a forum for the kids to use to talk to each other, as finding children who are open about their beliefs can be hard and can feel isolating. This may not be implemented in the proof of concept as the register and information on the children are the top priorities.
